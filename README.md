# Community Detection in a Gene Co-Expression Network  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project focuses on detecting communities within a human protein-protein interaction network using the Louvain algorithm. The goal is to extract groups of highly interconnected genes, which can provide insights into shared biological functions and regulatory mechanisms.  

## 🧬 Objective  
Studying gene co-expression communities helps in understanding biological processes and identifying functional modules, particularly in biomedical contexts such as cancer research and neurodegenerative diseases.  

## 🚀 Code Overview  
- **Data Loading**: Extracting protein interaction data from BioGRID.  
- **Graph Construction**: Representing the network as an undirected, weighted graph.  
- **Community Detection**: Applying the Louvain algorithm to segment the network.  
- **Community Evaluation**: Computing modularity and conductance metrics.  
- **Comparison with a Random Partition**: Assessing the significance of detected communities.  

## 🛠️ Usage  
1. Run the script in Google Colab or a Python-compatible environment.  
2. Adjust parameters if necessary (filters, community detection methods).  
3. Visualize and interpret the detected communities.
